As with Rocco's two-week marathon of persecution, we already know in advance that the Cloud will vote to get rid of me under any circumstances: it's their game and I'm a piece of the wrong color. So far, TFD has perjured himself shamelessly; not just the part where he denies that all of our sources recognize Geller as right-wing, but the whole false narrative woven out of random diffs that nobody thinks to check for themselves. I'd like to be able to say I'm surprised or disappointed, but this has happened too many times already.
It really comes down to whether the community has the will to oppose them. If not, then it gets what it deserves: more articles owned by the Cloud, fewer editors willing to contribute their free time. If we forcibly recused every member of the Cloud, the report against me would evaporate.

 Bank of America Anonymous 

Anonymous

On March 14, 2011, one or more members of the decentralized collective Anonymous began releasing emails it said were obtained from Bank of America. According to the group (along with recent federal investigations by State Attorneys General, the New York Department of Finance, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)  the emails document """"corruption and fraud"""" relating to the issue of """"large scale and repeated"""" force placed insurance abuse accelerating home foreclosures and automobile repossessions nationwide.  The source, identified publicly as Brian Penny, is a former LPI Specialist from Balboa Insurance, a firm which used to be owned by the bank, but was sold to Australian Reinsurance Company QBE, who subsequently branded the company QBE First in 2011  in order for the bank to obtain the funds necessary to pay back their Federal loans.

From the Hood quote it certainly looks as though it's altered enough (and both versions were successful enough) for each to have a separate article - that's one issue. (Although I do wonder about the 1983 Sadler's Wells version. If it had a new book and lyrics, it clearly wasn't Hood and Ross's version - so is it a version of Count, or of Graf? Does anyone know about the music?)

As for the other - I'd say it's definitely an operetta. Unless we can prove some substantial alteration of the music - style, vocal range, whatnot - it's the music from an operetta, and the show is an operetta.

On an unrelated note, doesn't anyone who's already worked on this article know how the plot resolves? """"Things work out okay and there's pretty music"""" isn't quote what one hopes to get out of a synopsis.""",0,0,0,0

The Bulgarians were early Zoroastrians - the cult to the Sun and the Fire, we were building fire temples like the Persian ones. There is not even one evidence to support the thesis that we were tengriists or that we called the god with the name Tangra/Tengri.

Lansing in """"Southern Michigan""""?
I think not. What is the source or justification for this apparently arbitrary decision? I say """"apparently arbitrary"""" because I can find no evidence that the regions of Michigan are official governmental designations.

 The media (Lansing State Journal, and TV Stations WLNS, WILX, WSYM)
all refer to Lansing as being in Mid-Michigan.

 A Google search for the terms Lansing and """"Mid Michigan"""" turns up many hits that would lead one to believe that Lansing is a part of """"Mid-Michigan.

 Conversely, a Google search for Lansing and """"Southern Michigan"""" turns up mostly references where Lansing happens to be mentioned in the same work as a reference to something outside of the Lansing area (in Southern Michigan).

 There are a number of businesses and organizations based in Lansing with """"Mid-Michigan"""" in their title. In the Lansing phone book, I find at least 50 businesses listed whose name begins with """"Mid-Michigan"""" (or """"Mid Michigan""""). I find one whose name begins with """"Southern Michigan"""".

I would argue that the boundary between """"Mid"""" (or Central) and """"Southern"""" Michigan lies somewhere south of Lansing and somewhere just north of Jackson. Perhaps [Leslie, Michigan|Leslie]] is nearer the border. I believe that once could safely draw the border to include all of Ingham County.

On these grounds, I suggest that in the name of factual accuracy, Lansing be moved (at least in Wikipedia) from """"Southern Michigan"""" to """"Central Michigan"""" (for which """"Mid-Michigan"""" is said to be a synonym).   """,0,0,0,0

ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any

They have looked only at the effects of collision on HD+; there are hardly any equations. They are not interested in quantum description of the whole process but only on what happened with the HD+ from which they read about used slit(s). But please respond, does the hellium go through the slits as a wave or as a particle? The Copenhagen interpretation discretizes experiments: during one, it must be either the former or the latter. If it is a particle, then it has a position or momentum during measurement (subject to uncertainty; they """"arise"""" upon measurement, according to orthodox Copenhagen, and arise randomly). Then, there are also things such as momentum transfer etc. which are usual for particles. If it is a wave, however, then it can interfere, and also it can be in many places at a time during measurement. But in this experiment both momentum transfer and wave effects happen during one process of leaving a slit. So please admit that the experiment shows something that is against the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation. Already for this reason it is worth mentioning here(!), but there is one more point.
If you take the Bohm's interpretation (which spreads properties such as charge or mass in space, if the article is not mistaken) and then apply the guiding equation not to one selected point, but to all continuum of points within the orbital, then you can easily explain how can something that acts as a particle go through both slits at a time. The interference pattern will arise due to similar effects as in Huygens' principle; momentum transfers from points (integrated, of course, because normally they will have only something like density of mass and thus density of momentum) will also follow normally. This looks like a quite natural explanation of the phenomenon, especially that photons most likely encounter the same thing when they bounce from shutters between the slits, etc. A very natural explanation is, then, that the apparent """"particle"""", subject to all QED equations etc., acts proportionally """"with its whole body"""" (can be normalized to 99% like with orbitals, so that the body does not extend infinitely in space). Every point follows its own way, when confronted with potentials of external fields, for instance (as in QED), though they have a common wavefunction and this makes them one and the same """"particle.""""
But this emergent interpretation, so natural and obvious, will never be compatible with the Copenhagen interpretation and the like, which assign certain probabilities to different outcomes of a measurement. This is why CI needs the distinction """"acts as a wave""""  """"acts as a particle"""" in experiment; in case of a particle you will have 1 position or momentum, subject to Heisenberg's, and in case of a wave you don't take these into account, so no problem! But never, in CI, you have a continuum of measurements for a certain wave function; because, then, without any collapse in between, ALL POSSIBILITIES would have to occur, otherwise I don't know how do you understand the word """"probability."""" You will not have an explanation why these other points are still """"with"""" the wavepacket and have not flown elsewhere. For such an explanation, you would have to introduce a causal component which actually cancels all your probabilities and, thus, all the individual life of the points of an orbital. This causal component exists in the Bohm's interpretation (applied separately to the points), because the guiding equation will make the points go in such a way that the """"centres of probability"""" are observed in choosing direction, and thus the points will keep close to the orbital, they will not escape.

Stan Heironymous, in his very well researched book on Belgian Brewing """"Brew Like A Monk"""", writes about La Trappe, which was briefly a trappist brewery in the Netherlands and had the appellation revoked when it sold to a Dutch Brewing company. According to those that sold, the problem was simply maintaining an order of monks. They did produce a beer which they called a Quadrupel. Moreover, Quadrupel has become a label on some american beers obviously of Belgian inspiration (and using derivatives of trappist yeast.) While this arguably makes Quadrupel not a style, Quadrupel is not listed as a style per say, but one of the myriad """"specialized"""" belgian ales.

 I really find your argument unconvincing, since the style guidelines make it clear that this category is to be used for submitting to beer competitions with a beer that is not appropriately labeled as something else, which is to say that the style category is quite upfront about what it is and not misleading at all. Yes, the BJCP styles include some catch all categories that aren't rightly considered styles, but they are clear about it when a judging category doesn't not fit some historically entrenched approach to beer. Since the guidelines are very clear about what they are but also provide a lot of accurate information to the reader, I think they're great. (Indeed, I would appriciate it if those that object would show me where the BJCP contradicts the opinions of other groups on these subjects.)""",0,0,0,0

Qwyrxian, let me attempt to point out the flaws of your response to my arguments set forth above: Yes, I'm a new editor, however, with all due respect, that has no bearing on your inclination to decide on behalf of all viewers what should be made available to them.

I very much understand the purpose of Wikipedia.  My assertion is NOT that the middle-finger incident should be included in the subject article (I started) because of news reports, as you contend.  If you will review the foregoing, the reason why I cited the news reports is because a flagrantly reckless comment was inserted that what is of issue now is not worthy of documenting when the exact opposite is true; the news reports is best evidence in that regard, and the person who said it is not worthy has only but his mouthan inferior source of 'evidence,' relatively speaking.  It is noteworthy, and, if you can come to appreciate the context of the subject's profession and for which has become known to be involved in, then you'll come to appreciate the significance it plays out in the essential need to properly reflect the entirety of the trial in which the subject became a major fixture as co-counsel.

Your example of everyday political speeches is seriously an aytypical example by which to convey your point:  Contrary to a mudane, everyday speech, here, an attorney just allegedly got out of court in obtaining a siginficant finding in his client's favordefeating immense odds and seemingly going against the court of public opinionand just afterwards gathered with his team at a restaurant just down the street from that historic victory, during which he released the manifestation of his emotions, etc., as one could imagine.  This was included as part of a segment of the whole article of the article-there is no article specifically on this incident, so let's also come to appreciate that.

And, to the contrary that this incident is of interest only at the moment, more and more discussions are being held about the audacious incident, and has cultivated an interest in what happens next, as if it is leading to a whole host of other actions (whether that includes the filing of a bar complaint, etc.), and this leads us to the national grand scale interest of the audacity of officers of courts acting in such a manner, etc.

Furthermore, I concede that Wikipedia is not in existence for the greater good, and that was never my contentio.  Again, you misunderstood the context I place in the words, """"public interests."""" Going back to the above, it is incontrovertible that is of the interests of the public, and, consequently, it should be documented well because, as noted in the latter paragraph, it is beginning to take shape in having a lasting impact on what we have come to expect from individuals, such as the subject of the article.

Let otherscertainly at least those who helped me in creating the articlechime in with their thoughts before you take an action on behalf everyone else.  Let's not do something in such a haphazard way.  Do not deny information in haste.   """,0,0,0,0

Speedy deletion of The outlyers
 A tag has been placed on The outlyers requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

The example is a poor one, and should be removed from the article. The article states that it seems to require 5 colors, presumably because the grey area cannot simply be colored red, yellow or blue without re-coloring. However, it *can* be colored green, and that doesn't require shuffling any of the other colors around. This makes it a very misleading counterexample. I know I spent a lot of time scratching my head wondering why this was considered a counter-example at all, and how the caption made any sense. Please either replace it with an example which does need to be re-colored in order to work or remove it (not that I don't think it's a valiant attempt, but it's just confusing).

First Lady Title
Last time I checked being a first lady is not a formal position and I am not sure why Wikipedia is misinforming people by posting this under the persons picture like it is a formal position. There is also """"In office"""" underneath the title. This is unprofessional and misinformation and should be removed from underneath the picture of the person.""",0,0,0,0
"""

 Troubling aspects of the artiicle as it exists right now 

1) I believe if Eric Altermann is to be accorded the prestige of being associated with msnbc.com, it should be noted that he is a blogger for msnbc.com. I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.

2) This is new. It's from Conason: """"Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments."""" Wow! That seems a little unfair just hanging out there like that. I propose either eliminating it or...and I hate this approach as much as the next guy...scotch-taping a quote after that which refutes this obvious cheap-shot.

3) This is old. The McVeigh section, as should be no surprise to anyone who's followed my work here, is troubling. Let's start with this quote: """" She was willing to characterize members of the Branch Davidians at the Waco compound as """"harmless American citizens"""" [6] even after the survivors of the raid and subsequent immolation of the group by their leader were convicted.""""
Well, some Waco compounders were convicted of something or another. But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent. 

This quote is also troubling: """"Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing."""" Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this:
""""Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.""""

Whady'a say?

(Much more on this section later.)

4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.

5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are """"not as bright"""" as men'?
Some editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected. But, unitl I'm proven it wrong, it should be excised in my view.

Speedy deletion of Opuce
 A tag has been placed on Opuce requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

The BCM is extremely notable and worth mentioning in this article. If you want to subdivide the article into pieces based on regionality, then let's create a Cotton Mills in America article and put the BCM at the top of the list.

Perhaps the framework of your date titling system in Cotton Mill is rubbish and needs to be changed, because no matter what stance we take here, the article is clearly missing information that could be incorporated. Providing only the information there allows people to make incorrect inferences.

In the context of Cotton Mill, are we to add an animal-powered category, or are we going to omit that from history?

The point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in AusE according to Felicity Cox (2005), and the phonetic transcription for that IDEA example I gave you transcribes man as , and indeed it sounds like that to my ears, although that speaker did seem a bit broad.  It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.

Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .

"Don't even start with me Mr. Confused Gender. You and your criminal friends started this war, and right now, you are loosing. You, Matthew, and your punk friends picked this fight when SORBS blocked my address without reason, then started slanderous material about me after you blocked me. Thats why SORBS.us went up, to fight SORBS, AHBL, SPEWS, and MAPS and your criminal activity. So don't you even think you will try to turn this around and make it look like I started it. This is a free country that protects 1st amendment rights from little commies like you. You are a sorry, pathetic, foul little queer creature who has no existance in today's world. What makes you think you are even worthy to stand in the same place as Steve Linford with your pathetic little pro-spam RBL?

As for your extortionist friend Matthew Sullivan, he will be arrested on sight should he ever come to the U.S. You and your extortionist, spammer friends are treading on very thin ice in the legal system right now. SORBS has blocked numerous valid systems,  as well as being kicked from XO for AUP violations, but you don't want that known. You prefer that people stay in the dark, and not have access to accurate information. If I had the time, I would list every valid system that SORBS has blocked, and refused to remove, as well as list your criminal record on AHBL's wiki.

You have attempted to halt the flow of new information on Wikipedia, and have tried numerous censorship schemes, not only to myself, but many others as well, and it is going to stop. Your Nazi dictatorship attitude won't get you far in this life little man. Everyone has the right to edit wikipedia with accurate information, If you have a problem with that, take it up with Wikipedia. - User:OryHara

""""White's diagnosis demonstrated to many that AIDS was not exclusive to homosexuals."""" Did it really demonstrate that the disease was not exclusive to a particular community, or did it demonstrate that it was not exclusively contracted through sexual contact? Did it really demonstrate to """"many"""" or did a significant number of people remain prejudiced?""""  Yes, the gay community felt very strongly that White's illness *did* demonstrate AIDS was not exclusive to a particular group of people.  Amongst those who remained prejudiced, they remained prejudiced by-and-large because they *wanted* it to be a gay-disease in order to either give them a better reason to be prejudiced against homosexuals or to promote their own cause and/or agenda.  But it wasn't as if White having AIDS suddenly changed the face of AIDS - it took time, but his illness *did* make a difference in how AIDS was thought of and perceived .  I remember once hearing an educated, well-known and repspected pastor and Bible scholar saying, """"AIDS is lodged in the rectum, that's why it's a homosexual, sodomite disease"""".  And that was *after* Ryan White died.  As far as the above claiming that there was """"resentment"""" amongst PWAs that it took White's illness to bring the proper attention to AIDS amongst the mainstream media and the rest of America - that's untrue.  There was general anger that there had been people dying of the disease for so long and no one outside the gay community seemed to care.  There was definite anger toward the Reagan administration, the Moral Majority and what was seen as the self-righteous extreme right.

"Ah, look, another sock-buddy of TheOldJacobtrite crawls out the woodwork to support his opinionated and personal-editing prejudice. And still they hypocritically defy admin.
Mark Arsten was the Admin who made the decision when TheOldJacobite tried to refer me for vandalism... Electric Wombat made his own views known.
Yes, the BBC appear to have archived off their radio interview and feature broadcast since the original edit. It looks like they do this after 14 days. However, the newspaper articles are still online, as is the download pages that prove that this was a properly released single with a full marketing and promotional plan behind it...(I suppose that you'll next be saying that Amazon and Apple are not credible reference points to confirm the song!!!). The charity's official website also contains a suitable reference that conforms to Wiki policy.  Their website is registered with the UK Government's Charity Commission as their official registered website, or are you intending to argue that the Charities Commission of the United Kingdom also fails to meet credibility policy?  (it would not surprise me if you did, even though that organization also has it's own Wiki entry and is referenced thousands of times in other articles - editors like you and TheOldjacobite like to pick and choose which reference points based on personal opinion, and not the fact of the matter.  That is shown in your logs. Having looked at WP:SONGCOVER for the twentieth time, this entry clearly meets all the criteria, so please stop quoting policy enforcement when the policy is met, otherwise you risk making yourself look more and more stupid every time you delete it or incorrectly quote a policy to which the entry conforms.
TheOldJacobite and his other sock-puppets, or buddy puppets, have referred the entry to admin, for both an (unfounded) allegation of vandalism, and whether the entry met policy criteria. He also asked for the page to be locked, and me blocked, on the basis of the entry - see the referrals for vandalism and page locking request pages...etc.  The entry was reviewed and found to be suitable and referenced correctly, even if the BBC programme has since been archived - that is, however, the whole point of the archival retrieval date noted within the reference tag.
The Admin do not feel that the page warrants locking, nor me to be blocked, as I am simply conforming to Wikipedia policies; policies that are so liberally quoted at me by those who then hypocritically contradict the very policy they like to crow about.
Is it any wonder that thousands of people are wholly unsatisfied with the general atmosphere within Wikipedia when a few (almost trolling) editors like to arbitrarily remove information simply based on personal views rather than verifiable links. TheOldJacobite, Sjo and now you, have simply shown that if you are proven wrong, had the policies correctly pointed out to you (later backed up by admin) you STILL will not accept the edit, preferring instead to continue playing childish games in repetitive removal of something to which you have some sort of weird personal issue with.
Your own deletion of this edit, following admin's clear acceptance of the entry is - like TheOldJacobite's and Sjo's behavior - now clearly in breach of Wiki policy and now suitable for requesting a temporary edit block to be placed on your account for, basically, ignoring admin's earlier decision on this matter.",0,0,0,0

Firstly, The concept of """"state terrorism"""" as it applies to declared war is inherently fringe. The USA and the Empire of Japan were engaged in a declared war. The idea of """"war terrorism"""", as outlined in the article now is a a neologism and shouldn't be included on Wikipedia. When you include information on the """"targeting of innocents to achieve a political goal"""" Hiroshima and Nagasaki were military targets and were defended by an air force.

""""Vajpayee remains PM till new pm is asked to form a government""""   is this accurate?  All the news stories I saw said that Vajpayee resigned immediately and his resignation was accepted by the president. This is not possible.- e 

He did in fact resign, and the president did accept it. However, as is custom, the president asked him to """"continue in office til alternative arrangements are made"""". (The Hindu) http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/holnus/001200405140111.htm

Was Manmohan Singh sworn-in on the 19th, or did he merely become the 'designate'? I have not seen anything saying he IS now PM.  18:46, May 20, 2004 (UTC)

 How about this? The article quite unequivocally states that Abdul Kalam appointed Singh PM. Is it a technical point that he is PM only after he's been sworn in?  | Talk 

 To summarise the entire process, once the election results in India are declared, the President has the prerogative to invite any person (by convention - the elected leader of the single largest party/coalition. Note again - the chosen leader of the party does not have to be a member of the parliament, as yet.) to form the government. Please note that invitation is not equal to appointment. If it is clear that the ruling party is getting the boot, the Prime Minister formally submits his resignation to the President, who advises him to stay in power until alternate arrangements are made. Technically, the new Prime Minister takes charge the moment the oath to the office of the Prime Minister and the oath to safeguard official secrecy are adminsitered. In case of disputed numbers, the elected government must prove its majority on the parliament hall by tabling a confidence motion, within a stipulated period. And if the leader is unelected, he/she is required to get elected from either houses of parliament within six months.

 The case of the Parliament is a little more curious. The parliament is born on the day of its first session, when the individual members are sworn in. So technically, as on date, India has a government without a parliament. It would continue to remain so, until June 2, when the monsoon session convenes.  13:37, May 27, 2004 (UTC)

 Thanks, , for the clarification.  | Talk 

First non-Hindu?
The article currently states that Manmohan Singh is the first non-Hindu to be PM. I know that a number of newspaper articles have been repeating this, but I think it's wrong (or at least disputable) in that Rajiv Gandhi was a Parsee. At any rate, his father Feroze Gandhi was half-Muslim and half-Parsee, and if I'm not mistaken Zoroastrianism was the religion passed down to Rajiv and Sanjay (not that anybody in the family is exactly religious!).  00:14, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

The Wallace line demarcates biogeographical continents, which to a large extent coincide with the geological continents. On those grounds, East Timor is not a part of Asia. On the other hand, it seems that geopolitically East Timor is considered a part of Asia.
There are two problems I see with your position.
Firstly, Oceania is a geopolitical continent, not a biogeographic or geological one. From the geopolitical point of view, East Timor is in Asia. From any other point of view, Oceania doesn't exist. Either way, East Timor is not a part of Oceania.
Secondly, reputable sources have been presented, which state straight out that East Timor is in Asia. They may not state their criteria, but they are unambiguous in their position. You, on the other hand, are unable to present any sources, and are relying entirely upon reasoning. I salute your reasoning, but the fact is the sources win.

What is the authority and credibility of this kid in the matter of languages? He didn't finished his highschool yet. All other words are useless …

Who is Node? Who is Mark Williamson? Just look at the picture:

Poor little Node having problem with languages! Sic!

I think Mark Williamson known also as """"Node ue"""" is having difficulties  with the words out of his mouth!

Nevertheless the authority of Node_ue is very good presented by himself in [] 

Just take a look the way the Kid Mark looks himself: (Warning! May be in various ways interpreted!) 

Mark is an all-powerful entity made of pure energy. If you know him, you will be blessed and your dreams will come true (or at least they might).

Strengths: All powerful, handsome, smart.

Weaknesses: NONE!!! THE GREAT MARK HAS NO WEAKNESSES! HE IS ALL-POWERFUL!

Special Skills: All-powerfulness, intelligence, &c.;

Weapons: All-powerfulness... sharp teeth... hrm...

All-powerfulness: YES! THE GREAT ENTITY KNOWN AS """"MARK"""" IS ALL-POWERFUL!!! YES!

""""I've also noticed a few things that are possible hints at his thinking he's homosexual/bisexual but not wanting to admit it to himself:

 Section needs to be edited 

This line about New Hampshire is not very accurate:

On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Day was officially observed in all 50 states.[4] Prior to that New Hampshire and Arizona did not observe the day.

In fact, New Hampshire passed """"Civil Rights Day"""" in 1991, to honor Dr King, and other civil rights activists like Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.  Since the article states clearly that other states, such as Utah, have different names for the holiday, including combining it with Confederate military heroes, this sentence does not seem justifiable.  The article leaves the impression that New Hampshire was some sort of bigoted state, that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.

Not sure the recent edit changing Tyler from """"Anarchist"""" to """"Nihilist"""" is accurate. Tyler certainly does have a ethos and creed, where as a nihilist does not. His creed can certainly be said to be destruction of the current culture and certainly retrograde in many respects, seeking to return to a simpler subsistence level of existence (i.e. hunter/gatherer) but he definitely has an established ethos and world-view. It is simply contrary to much of modern society. I posit that the edit should be reverted back to anarchist.  17:56, Apr 9, 2004 (UTC)

Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe
Hey, a few years ago I was reading a really old Reader's Digest and I swear I actually read an article written first person from an organ's point of view.  (I don't remember which.)

...and the guy's name was Joe.

This was before I read the book, so I just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time...I can't seem to find the article anymore, though.  Does anyone else have any info on this?  Was Joe changed to Jack to avoid legal troubles with the original """"Joe's XXXXXX"""" author?

 The author of the book was talking about real stories from Reader's Digest, so you probably did read the same ones he refered to. """"Joe"""" is changed to """"Jack"""" in the movie because Reader's Digest wasn't willing to allow them to mention it in the film.  LGagnon

I have a copy of John Pekkanen's article """"I am John's Brain Tumour"""", from Reader's Digest (South Africa) 1990-12, volume 137, number 824. Chapter 7 of my copy of Palahniuk's Fight club has """"I am Jane's Uterus. I am Joe's Prostate. [...] I am totally Joe's Gallbladder"""", ISBN 0-099-28333-6, Vintage (1997) UK Random House. The English RD sites I searched came up empty. The earliet """"Joe""""s I found were two 1974 videos  from """"Pyramid Films"""". I found that """"Pyramid Media"""" credits it to RD . Does anyone have a source of an actual Reader's Digest article with """"Joe""""? - , 2004-04-15t22:37z

 It is mentioned on the commentary for the DVD that Reader's Digest told them not to use """"Joe"""". Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that """"Joe"""" should be used more often in the article than """"Jack"""" (though """"the narrator"""" fits the character's """"name"""" more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable. Otherwise, what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the Lord of the Rings article more about the Peter Jackson movie than JRR Tolkien's work.  LGagnon

Tyler section
We should merge the Tyler Durden section into the characters section. There isn't a need for 2 separate sections on him. As it is it looks redundant and a bit sloppy. Any details that don't fit that section can go into a different one.  LGagnon

Backstory of the novel
I just recently updated the article on Chuck Palahniuk with info on how Fight Club came to be. This is in the first paragraph of the Biography section. I was wondering if anyone thought we should include that info in this article, since it gives the backstory of how it was written.   Talk]] 12:00, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Movie & Book Balance

I have fixed a recent re-write of the plot section (which made it even more biased in favor of the film), but more work could be done to balance the article.

Hi, thanks for the email. I assume it's the article above to which you refer. I deleted your article because it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts or show that it meets the notability guidelines. It is also now wikipedia policy that biographical articles about living people must have independent verifiable references. As a matter of policy, all biographies of living people will be deleted if they do not have references. Although you gave references, one was to a commercial sales site, which is spammy, one was your own site, and the other was an anonymous review by an unknown editor.

Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. This seemed to be intended to promote your autobiography. You have an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to editing articles about this subject. Thank you for declaring your interest - your honesty in this matter is appreciated. If, after reading the information about notability linked above, you still believe that you are notable enough for a Wikipedia article (and that there is significant coverage of the centre in reliable, independent secondary sources), you could post a request at Wikipedia:Requested articles for the article to be created. See also Wikipedia:Best practices for editors with conflicts of interest.

I deleted the article about the book too. The article was substantially a copyright violation, taken from Amazon (© 1996-2012, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates). Copyrighted text is not allowed in Wikipedia, as outlined in this policy. It again did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts or show that it meets the notability guidelines for books, and the links were to sales or other dubious sites.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

"Your creepy fucking head 

Hello jimmy boy,

I've just started editing this Wikipedia. When I go to other users pages I often find your creepy fucking head appearing from the left side of the screen.

It's disgusting. I'm an adult and I don't need a note from you.

Could you ask one of your programmers to stop having your creepy fucking head appear on the left side of people's screens? I've asked my brother to kill you if I have to see it again and he said he would.

Best regards,

 User Marskell",1,1,1,0

"Albanians have nothing in common with Azeri/Turk people 
Albanians have never formed a nation. They were represented by 26 different tribes, each talking their own language. These tribes existed till XII century. They don't exist now. However, Armenians existed before and they exist today, they live in Artsakh today. 
Azeri people are muslims, while Albanians were christian.
All known Albanian languages are not even close to Turkish languages: these languages belong to different groups.

Taking all these facts into consideration, it is not clear what Azeris have to do with Artsakh or with ancient Albanians. Turkic population came to this area 600 years ago, while Armenian lived there for more then 2000 years...",0,0,0,0

In fact, the name of the program Ang Dating Daan cannot be found anywhere on that Inquirer.net article. Therefore, it does not qualify as reference, not because Inquirer.net is not reliable, but because the idea that you're trying to convey is not supported by the article.

If you truly value Philippine-related articles then you should be extra careful not to destroy their quality and credibility. Also, since you are editing the Tagalog Wikipedia, may I suggest that you begin creating a Tagalog version of the English WP articles on Eli soriano and Ang Dating Daan? If you don't do it, someone else is going to do it sooner or later.

As near as I can tell, wikipedia has no article on """"cycle structure"""". The cycle structure of an element g of a permutation group is the multi-set of sizes of orbits of the cyclic group generated by g. This is related to the cycle decomposition of g when g only has finite orbits, which takes orbit representatives a1, a2, ... and specifies g by (a1, a1^g, a1^(g^2), ... )(a2, a2^g, ...) where each tuple has no duplicate entries. This is also called """"cycle notation"""", and the """"cycle structure"""" is the list of cycle sizes.

 Suggesion for a more compact grid 

I'd like to propose a new grid format for the income inequality list. I've uploaded a screenshot here. By combining the UN/CIA """"R/P 10%"""" columns and the World Bank/CIA/GPI """"Gini index"""" columns, and by writing the years directly besides the values, we can make this grid much more readable. Of course, one could not sort by year anymore, but I don't think this is such an issue. Whichever source (UN, CIA, WB, GPI) has the latest value, that source's data should be displayed. I don't see a need for displaying different sources, since they probably all calculate those indices using the same data. I'll leave some time for people to comment on my proposal, and if no one minds, I'll go ahead and implement it.   """,0,0,0,0

From Kind Singaporean to SG man: 
I already stated earlier that the information I gave was true right up to 2003, thus this article is a piece of history: a recollection of things and experiences that are already passed.

There have been a lot of changes in the SPF in the 2 years since then, many of which I am not aware of. Guess LSF had experienced """"a wind of change"""" by now, who knows?

Besides, during my years there, LSF regularly used the parade square in SOC for their drills and other training purposes (and I guess they still do today). All these could be witnessed by residents in nearby HDB blocks with their naked eyes. Thus, LSF activities and going-ons then were no secret. Any Tom, Dick and Harry from outside could take a peek on us.

In view of these, I strongly believe that publishing this article is appropriate. I know where's my OB markers are. I thank SG man for his concern. -14 January 2006""",0,0,0,0

"List of ice hockey teams in Ontario 

I updated Template:OHL and Template:Defunct OHL to try to simplify things. Template:OHL contains all teams past and current for the OHL. Template:Defunct OHL contains all past teams from the OMJHL and the OHA Junior A. That template may need to be renamed. 

Regarding the article List of ice hockey teams in Ontario. How should we handle the defunct teams from the OHL, OMJHL, and OHA Junior A?  
That is a really good question.  I would like to add them, as it would allow the list to be both complete, and consistant with the others.  I havent added defunct Jr A teams on any other article, but many of these OHA Jr A teams were the highest level of Junior hockey at the time, I believe, so should be added as being equivalent of Major-Junior.  However, that will likely make this a really long list.  It might make sense to split the article into two: active and defunct  as I did with the baseball lists. I would suggest expanding the defunct teams and seeing how long the article gets, then deciding from there.  If we hope to get it to featured list status, as I would like for all, then we can't use the template as a part of the article itself.",0,0,0,0

"Example Citation 

For the paragraph:

Some judges are also known to rule against precedent on principle. A judge (or even an interim appeal court) may rule against a precedent that is outdated. The judge may feel the decision needs to be overturned due to more sophisticated legal reasoning. Such a judge may wish to help the law evolve by ruling against precedent and thereby indirectly inducing a losing party to appeal. The appeal court will then have an opportunity to review the lower court's decision and may adopt the lower court's reasoning, thereby overturning previous case law. This may also happen several times as the case works its way through intermediate appellate jurisdictions.

Would it be an idea to provide an example? A world-famous example is the Warren court's overturning of Plessy v. Ferguson in Brown v. Board of Education.",0,0,0,0

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you. If you're going to be an admin, may I suggest you please make yourself familiar with the policies and guidelines I have referenced in this message.

Hey! Thanks for being a dick and adding a warning template on an IP talk page instead of fixing your fuck up. Your mindbogglingly idiotic idea that the  background section should follow the one editorial you read instead of countless other sources is superb. Way to fuck up a massive section in a highly read article you fucking dolt.,1,0,1,0

"In defence of China! 

Hey Koreans, who the fuck do you think you're dealing with. Guess what, Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks. After the fall of the Tang Dynasty, close to 700,000 were incorporated into Tang history, a little less than half migrated to the Central Plains, 100,000 to the Chinese state of Bohai and only 100,000 into Xinluo (Silla). Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force. If anything, Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang. Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal, nothing more. The greatest threat came from the TuBo, TuJue and HuiHe from the west. Koreans are a bunch of fucking attention whores.

You fucking barbarian kimchi gooks have a lot of nerve to badmouth your former masters, considering the fact that you were our little dog for most of your existance. Not to mention your stupid kings would submit to the Imperial envoy in the direction of the Great Emperor of China. Fucking barbarian gooks got a lot of nerve to mess with us. We are the descendants of the great Yellow Emperor and the inheritors of the Great Han and Tang Dynasties. Stupid barbarian shit, don't piss us off.",1,0,1,1

You know, I'm leaning more and more towards Roger's opinion here: knowing what we know about the sources, I think it's implied that IBM re-invented DC, but it's not unambiguous, and it's really not such a critical point to this article.  I think we should just say that IBM was aware of differential cryptanalysis but didn't publish it, at least in this article: the proper place to get into this in detail would be in the Data Encryption Standard article or the differential cryptanalysis article.  juicetalk """,0,0,0,0

"""::::::: Thank you.  But the article on greenhouse gases says """"Other important considerations involve water vapor being the only greenhouse gas whose concentration is highly variable in space and time in the atmosphere and the only one that also exists in both liquid and solid phases, frequently changing to and from each of the three phases or existing in mixes. Such considerations include clouds themselves, air and water vapor density interactions when they are the same or different temperatures, the absorption and release of kinetic energy as water evaporates and condenses to and from vapor, and behaviors related to vapor partial pressure. """"  Is this variability also well understood, and predictable?  That was behind my question.
